# UFOs
## Overview
For this week's module, we created a webpage about the topic of UFO sightings and included data on descriptors of incidents of sightings. The webpage included a desription of the purpose of the webpage as well as a table of data about UFO sightings and a filter option to allow the user to search through the data set for sightings that meet certain criteria. 

## Results
The webpage's filter option included several options that the user can use to search through the data for sightings that meet the criteria. A screenshot of the filters and part of the data is below:

As you can see, the user can filter through the data by five different criteria: date, city, state, country, and shape. To filter through the data, the user simply has to input the criteria he or she wants the results to meet and then press "Enter." An example of the search can be seen below:

## Summary
### Are there any downsides of this webpage layout?
One drawback of this design is that it does not allow the user to search on multiple criteria at once to search for entries that meet one criteria OR another. The way this filter function works is that it only allows the user to input two or more values into the search bar to find entries that meet all of the criteria. If you wanted to search for UFO sightings that were either in the state of Arizona or took place on 1/15/10, for example, you would have to do two individual searches instead of one. 

### What are some ways we could further develop the webpage in the future?
For future development of this webpage, we could work on adding another search function to allow the user to filer by 'duration' as a criteria. This value is included in the data set but is not included as an option to filter by. Another recommendation for future development would be to add a search function to allow the user to search for entries based on the 'comments' column by keywords. For example, if a user only wanted to see entries where the comments included a mention of red lights, they could search for the keyword 'red lights' or even simply 'red.'
